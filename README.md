# P-CodeSum

## Introduction

We introduce P-CodeSum, a novel approach that focuses on automatically generating code summaries tailored to specific projects in few-shot scenarios.

The contributions of this work are as follows:

* We empirically study the performance of large language models (LLMs) on project-specific code summarization tasks and explore key factors to high-quality prompts.

* We propose a neural prompt selector trained on data generated by LLM, obtaining project-specific examples for in-context learning in the few-shot situation.

* We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate P-CodeSum. Results demonstrate the high quality of prompts generated by our selector and the significant improvements that P-CodeSum brings to PCS tasks.

The data and its generation method are explained in [Data](#my-data).
